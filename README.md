# Breast Cancer Prediction
To predict breast cancer in patients using classification models such as random forest, support vector machine, and stacking ensemble method. We would like to see if other classification models can outperform logistic regression in predicting breast cancer in patients. 

Eventually we are able to make the prediction with a recall of 0.99 (class 0, no cancer) and 0.95 (class 1, have cancer) with an ensemble method.
